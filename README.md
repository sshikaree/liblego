This is rewrite of [cascadia](https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia) in C,
adapted for use with [libtidy](https://www.html-tidy.org) and inspired by [goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery).

### Dependencies:
- libtidy

	On Ubuntu Linux it can be installed by 
	```
	# apt install libtidy-dev
	```
